<h2>🧑🏻‍💻 About me</h2>

Hello, I'am Rayan 👋

I started coding six years ago as a self-taught developer, driven by curiosity and a genuine interest in how things work under the hood.

In the beginning, I focused on learning the fundamentals, understanding core programming concepts, building small projects, breaking things, fixing them, and repeating the process. That hands-on exploration helped me develop problem-solving skills and technical autonomy.

To take things further and structure my knowledge, I later joined an intensive in-company training program at Le Reacteur, where I consolidated my skills and deepened my expertise in modern web development.

Today, I work as a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>, building applications with a strong focus on clean architecture, maintainable code, and product-oriented thinking.
